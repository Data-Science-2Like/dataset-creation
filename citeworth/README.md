# Create the Dataset for the CiteWorth module from our preprocessed S2ORC dataset

## Usage
The resulting files are output in this `dataset` directory.

There is no commandline interface provided. Please, uncomment the method call and set its parameters directly in the `citeworth_dataset.py` file.  
You may place the S2ORC dataset into the `../data_s2orc` directory.

## Further Information
We generally only consider papers that uniquely belong to the field of "Computer Science" and where the year of publication is known.  
Further, we remove any entries belonging to the "Abstract"-Section as our structure analysis does not consider abstracts and usually there are no cite-worthy contexts in the abstract.  
Finally, it needs to be known for every sentence in a paragraph whether it is cite-worthy or not in order for the paragraph to be considered in the dataset.

The resulting output files are:
- train.jsonl
  - contains all paragraphs of papers published until including `max_train_year`
  - and only those where every sentence in the paragraph conforms to the conditions defined in [[1](#1)]
- val.jsonl
  - contains all paragraphs of papers published after `max_train_year` until including `max_val_year`
  - and only those where every sentence in the paragraph conforms to the conditions defined in [[1](#1)]
- test.jsonl
  - contains all paragraphs of papers published after `max_val_year`
- test_conform.jsonl
  - contains all paragraphs of papers published after `max_val_year`
  - and only those where every sentence in the paragraph conforms to the conditions defined in [[1](#1)]
- test_non_conform.jsonl
  - contains all paragraphs of papers published after `max_val_year`
  - and only those where every sentence in the paragraph does not conform to the conditions defined in [[1](#1)]
